Certain values can also be filled using pandas interpolate() that calculates what missing value should be, based on the previous values but this can only work for features like ID code.

    "Answer- Dealing with missing data values is a crucial step in data preprocessing. Several methods can be used to handle missing values, each with its advantages and limitations. Here are some commonly used methods for dealing with missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deletion Methods:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a. Listwise Deletion: In this method, any data record with missing values is entirely removed from the dataset. It is the simplest approach but can result in a loss of information if the missing values are not randomly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Pairwise Deletion: This method involves using available data for each specific analysis, discarding only the missing values for that particular analysis. It maximizes the use of available data but can lead to varying sample sizes across different analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mean/Mode Imputation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a. Mean Imputation: Missing values in a numeric variable are replaced with the mean of the observed values for that variable. It assumes that the missing values have a similar distribution as the observed values. However, it can distort the mean and standard deviation of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Mode Imputation: Missing values in a categorical variable are replaced with the mode (most frequent category) of the observed values. This method is applicable only to categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Median/Most Frequent Imputation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a. Median Imputation: Missing values in a numeric variable are replaced with the median of the observed values for that variable. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to mean imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Most Frequent Imputation: Missing values in a categorical variable are replaced with the most frequent category observed for that variable. It works well for variables with skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hot Deck Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, missing values are imputed by borrowing values from similar records in the dataset. The similar records are identified based on a set of matching variables. The imputed values are randomly selected from the pool of similar records, ensuring variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Regression Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values are estimated using regression models. A regression model is built with the variable containing missing values as the dependent variable and other variables as predictors. The missing values are then predicted based on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Multiple Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple imputation creates multiple plausible imputed datasets, where missing values are imputed using advanced techniques like regression imputation or predictive mean matching. The imputed datasets are analyzed separately, and the results are combined using specific rules to account for the uncertainty introduced by imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Maximum Likelihood Estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum likelihood estimation involves using statistical models to estimate the missing values based on the observed data and their relationships. It accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing values and provides unbiased parameter estimates.\n",

Q1 represents the 25th percentile of the data.The interquartile range is calculated in much the same way as the range.

    "The IQR provides valuable information about the variability and distribution of the data, particularly in the central portion where the majority of the observations lie.\n",
    "A larger IQR indicates a wider spread or greater variability, while a smaller IQR suggests a narrower spread or lower variability.\n",

It provides a visual representation of the data's distribution, including information about the shape, center, and spread. Histograms are useful for understanding the overall pattern of the data, identifying skewness or outliers, and assessing the data's symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, summarizes the distribution of data using quartiles. It displays the median, quartiles (Q1 and Q3), and any potential outliers. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR) and spans the middle 50% of the data. The whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the IQR. Box plots are useful for comparing distributions, identifying skewness or outliers, and visualizing the spread and central tendency of the data."
