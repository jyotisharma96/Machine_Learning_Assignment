    "Answer- The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a philosophical and mathematical framework that views probability as a measure of uncertainty or subjective belief. It is named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century mathematician and statistician. In the Bayesian framework, probability represents a degree of belief or confidence in the occurrence or truth of an event, given the available evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian probability theory, probabilities are updated based on new evidence using Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that the posterior probability of an event, given the observed evidence, is proportional to the prior probability of the event multiplied by the likelihood of the evidence given the event. This updating process allows for the incorporation of new information and the revision of beliefs."
