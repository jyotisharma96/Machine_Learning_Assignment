    "Answer- In the context of machine learning, the target function refers to the function or model that we aim to learn or approximate from the available data. It represents the relationship between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target) that we want to predict or understand.\n",

    "The fitness of a target function is typically assessed by evaluating its performance on unseen data or a validation dataset. The performance metrics used to assess fitness depend on the specific problem and the nature of the target function.

The lower the value of the evaluation metric, the better the fitness of the target function.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. In the sense of machine learning models, what is underfitting? What is the most common reason for underfitting: Underfitting is a scenario in data science where a data model is unable to capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen: Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the sense of model fitting, explain the bias-variance trade-off: The bias is known as the difference between the prediction of the values by the ML model and the correct value. Being high in biasing gives a large error in training as well as testing data. By high bias, the data predicted is in a straight line format, thus not fitting accurately in the data in the data set."

The exact opposite happens in backward feature selection.\n"

They learn the relationship between the features and the class labels to classify new instances into predefined categories. Numerical data, on the other hand, consists of continuous or discrete numeric values. Classification models cannot directly handle numerical data as inputs because they operate on categorical variables. Converting numerical data into categories or bins can result in a loss of information and may not effectively capture the underlying patterns or relationships in the data.\n",

    "1. __The process of holding out__: Holding out refers to the practice of reserving a portion of the available data for testing or validation purposes. It involves splitting the dataset into two or more subsets: one for training the model and another for evaluating its performance. By holding out a separate validation set, we can assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data and detect potential issues like overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Cross-validation by tenfold__: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model and estimate its generalization ability. Tenfold cross-validation is a specific method where the dataset is divided into ten equal-sized subsets or folds. The model is trained and evaluated ten times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining nine folds as the training set. This allows for a more reliable estimate of the model's performance by considering multiple validation sets and reducing the dependency on a single split.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Adjusting the parameters__: Adjusting the parameters refers to the process of optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are settings or configurations that are not learned from the data but set before the training process. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization strength, number of hidden layers, or number of decision trees. Adjusting these parameters is crucial to find the optimal combination that maximizes the model's performance. Techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be used to systematically explore the hyperparameter space and select the best parameter values based on evaluation metrics or cross-validation results. The goal is to fine-tune the model to achieve the best possible performance on the given task.\n"

    "1. __Purity vs. Silhouette width__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purity is a measure used in clustering algorithms to evaluate the homogeneity of clusters. It quantifies how much the objects within a cluster belong to the same class or category. Higher purity indicates that the majority of objects within a cluster belong to the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Silhouette width is a measure used to assess the quality of clustering results. It calculates the average dissimilarity between each object and objects in other clusters relative to the dissimilarity within the same cluster. Higher silhouette width values indicate better-defined and well-separated clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Boosting vs. Bagging__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting and bagging are both ensemble learning methods that aim to improve the performance of machine learning models by combining multiple weak models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an iterative process where weak models are trained sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing on the examples that the previous models struggled with. Boosting aims to create a strong model by giving more importance to misclassified instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (short for bootstrap aggregating) involves training multiple independent models on different subsets of the training data, created through random sampling with replacement. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all models, typically by majority voting (in classification) or averaging (in regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __The eager learner vs. the lazy learner__:\n",
    "\n",
    "The eager learner, also known as an eager or eager learning algorithm, is a type of machine learning algorithm that constructs a model during the training phase. It eagerly uses all available training data to build the model upfront, and once trained, it discards the training data. Examples of eager learners include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lazy learner, also known as a lazy or lazy learning algorithm, defers the construction of a model until a prediction needs to be made. It stores the entire training dataset and uses it directly for prediction. Lazy learners do not explicitly build a generalized model but instead rely on the similarity between the new instance and the training instances to make predictions. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a common example of a lazy learning algorithm.\n"
