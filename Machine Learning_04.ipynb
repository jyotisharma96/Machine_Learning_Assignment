    "Feature selection is a technique using which, the most important of features or those features that bring most information with them to machine learning modeling process in predicting or clustering are included and the rest are removed Dimensionality reduction is a process by which the explanatory features are transformed and elevated to a lower dimension. It is also the process by which the irrelevant features are removed. Several machine learning algorithms are highly negatively affected by high dimensionality, due to which this process becomes very important."

    "i. __The Histogram__:\n",
    "\n",
    "A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset.\n",
    "It consists of a series of adjacent rectangles (bars) where the area of each rectangle represents the frequency or relative frequency of data within a specific interval or bin.\n",
    "Histograms are commonly used to visualize the distribution of numerical data, allowing us to understand the central tendency, spread, and shape of the data.\n",
    "They provide insights into the data's skewness, kurtosis, and presence of outliers.\n",
    "Histograms are useful for exploring patterns, identifying data clusters, and making data-driven decisions in various fields such as statistics, data analysis, and quality control.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. __Scatter Plot__:\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is a two-dimensional data visualization technique that uses dots (or markers) to represent the values of two variables.\n",
    "Each dot on the plot represents a single data point, with the x-axis representing one variable and the y-axis representing another variable.\n",
    "Scatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables and examining patterns or trends in the data.\n",
    "They can show the presence of a correlation, such as positive or negative linear relationships, or the absence of any significant relationship.\n",
    "Scatter plots are commonly used in fields such as data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and social sciences to explore and understand the relationship between variables, detect outliers, and identify clusters or groups within the data."

    "There can be some differences in how qualitative and quantitative data are explored:\n",
    "\n",

    "It often involves reading and interpreting the data to identify themes, patterns, and recurring concepts.\n",
    "Techniques such as content analysis, thematic analysis, or grounded theory can be used to explore qualitative data.\n",
    "Qualitative data exploration focuses on understanding the richness and depth of the data, uncovering nuances, and capturing the context and meaning behind the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Quantitative Data Exploration__: Quantitative data exploration involves analyzing numerical data using statistical methods and techniques.\n",
    "It includes summary statistics, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution, central tendency, spread, and relationships between variables.\n",
    "Techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, correlation analysis, or regression analysis are commonly used to explore quantitative data.\n",
    "Quantitative data exploration aims to identify patterns, outliers, associations, and trends in the data, and to assess the statistical significance of the findings."
